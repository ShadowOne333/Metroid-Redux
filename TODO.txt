Pending things for Metroid Redux:

	* Fix the Missile explosion graphics
	* Modify the gravity so Samus falls faster (optional)
	* Modify Saving 0.5.2 so it properly shows all 8 Energy Tanks on the save file
	* Implement Samus' unused left sprites when walking and shooting
	* Modify Samus' Power Suit palette to closely match her proper Power Suit color scheme
	* Modify Samus' Varia Suit palette to closely match her proper Varia Suit color scheme
	* Probably change her visor color a bit when Missiles are active as well
	* Modify Samus' sprite to match her Power Suit design
	* Modify Samus' Morph Ball sprites to closely match the official design
	* Add Spring Ball when obtaining Hi Jump
	* Add Automap (?)
	* 


	* Test out the entire game with both Mother + Saving v0.5.2 and see if there's anything out of place
